# Brunch with coffee demo
This is a sample application using [Brunch](http://brunch.io/) that mimics an IOS style alert center.

Main languages are [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and
[Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/).

## Getting started

Clone the repo and run `npm install` & `brunch build`.
Then start the server using `coffee server.coffee`.
